Implemented using : 
1. Bulma framework for CSS. This is a breeze to implement and has a very short learning curve. The best part is that it is web 
responseive by default. We need very little to zero efforts to make it look good for mobiles and tablets.
2. React part was challenging as I had to make the input box respond to responses from multiple buttons on the page. In fact, at the time of writing 
this, it is still responding to just the first button clicks like 'Frontend', 'Fullstack', 'Backend' on the page. This is WIP.
