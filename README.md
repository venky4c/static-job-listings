Key Learnings:
- The data has nesting upto 4 levels and it was a challenge to filter data based on user input selection based on intermediate levels of data nesting. 
- Used arrays as data type for state management and ensured the manipulation of data is pure without side effects by using spread operator. 
> Using callback function for state management by passing the functions as props to the required classes, for the removing of buttons inside
the searchbar.
- CSS: **Bulma framework for CSS**. This is **web responseive** by default. 
- Use of cards, box shadow feature, showing left border on hover for just the desktop version etc were all nice features to implement.
